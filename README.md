## Building

Building a Game Bub handheld requires manufacturing PCBs, 3D printing the shell and buttons, and assembling components from a variety of sources. For information on manufacturing and assembling your own, see [here](https://github.com/elipsitz/gamebub/blob/v0.1/docs/building.md). Note that this information is for the older, vertical revision 2. Updated building information will be available in the Game Bub Docs soon.

## Architecture

For an in-depth description of the project architecture, as of revision 2, see [here](https://github.com/elipsitz/gamebub/blob/v0.1/docs/architecture.md).

A Nix flake (`flake.nix`) provides the complete FPGA and firmware toolchain: `nix develop`.

The Game Bub handheld consists of a Xilinx XC7A100T FPGA to do the main emulation and I/O, and an ESP32-S3 microcontroller to do auxiliary tasks (configuring the FPGA, rendering the UI, loading ROM files from a microSD card and sending it to the FPGA).

### Directory Structure
